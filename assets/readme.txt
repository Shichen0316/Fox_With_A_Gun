Let's use this for uploading specific assets. We can make the items (character, weapon...)
in their dedicated folders to keep it consistent. So here just asset, in dedicated folder
we build them up so that they can move / make sound / etc.

graphics:
- sprites - .png or .svg files for characters, enemies, weapons, UI elements
- backgrounds - .png or .svg files for static or scrolling backgrounds

audio:
- music - .ogg or .mp3 files for background music
- sound effects - files for actions like shooting, hits, charms

animation
- character - .escn or .anim files for character and enemy animations.
- weapons - .escn or .anim files for weapon firing and effects animations
