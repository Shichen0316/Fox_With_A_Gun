Here we make the game logic and connect the parts together.
In the controllers folder we should add scripts that handle specific parts of the game.

playerController - .gd scripts for controlling player movement, shooting, charm abilities
enemyController - .gd scripts for enemy behaviors, reactions to being charmed
weaponController - .gd scripts for handling weapon behaviors, ammo, and firing rates, and changing weapons
waveController - .gd scripts for managing the sequence, difficulty of waves and enemy spawning
gameController - .gd scripts for overall game state management (active, paused, game over)
