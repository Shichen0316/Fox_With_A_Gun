Here we give life to the characters using the assets.
In the characters folder, dedicated to the game characters:

player - contains all files specific to the player character, including sprites, scripts, and animations (if coded)
enemy - subfolders for each type of enemy with their specific sprites, scripts, and animations (if coded)
